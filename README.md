The below link is to my Confluence page for my project on climate Change. My contribution to a group project was focused on the impacts of climate change on the planet, where I was responsible for setting up and managing a JIRA dashboard to track progress; made a Github repostitory for file tracking and the Confluence page for documentation, where i wrote the final report.
